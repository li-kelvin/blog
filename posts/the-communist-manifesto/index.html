    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Karl Marx (1818-1883) was a german philosopher, economist, and sociologist who met Friederich Engels (1820-1895), another socially-minded German philosopher. They joined a new political society called the League of the Just in 1847, creating the Communist Manifesto together. The Manifesto is split into three sections:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>historical context/nature of contemporary capitalist society</p>        
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>setting forth objectives</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>why it was better than other socialist movements</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Bourgeoise and Proletarians</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>bourgeoise = class of modern capitalist, owners of means of production and employers of wage labor </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>proletariat = no means of production on their own, reduced to selling labor/power to live</p>
            </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In earlier ages, we saw society arranged into complicated class structures. For example, there were feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, and apprentices in medieval times. Modern bourgeois society sprouted from the ruins of feudal society. This society has become simplified into two rival camps--Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.</p>
    <p>The Manifesto shows how the modern bourgeoisie is the product of several revolutions in production and exchange. The development of the bourgeoisie began in the earliest towns and gained momentum with the Age of Exploration. Feudal guilds couldn&#39;t provide for increasing markets, and the manufacturing middle class took its place. However, demand kept growing, and manufacturing couldn&#39;t keep up. This led to the Industrial Revolution. </p>
    <p>A series of political developments accompanied the development of the bourgeoisie as a class. With the growth of Modern Industry and the world market, the bourgeoisie has gained exclusive political sway. The State serves the bourgeoisie&#39;s interests solely. Thus, exploitation that used to be veiled by religious and political &quot;illusions&quot; is now direct, brutal, and blatant.</p>
    <p>Because the bourgeoisie needs a constantly expanding market, it settles and establishes connections all over the globe. Production and consumption have taken on a cosmopolitan character in every country. This is true both for materials and intellectual output, as national sovereignty and isolationism become less and less possible to sustain. The bourgeoisie draws even the most barbarous nations into civilization and compels all countries to adopt its mode of production. It &quot;creates a world after its image.&quot; All become dependent on the bourgeoisie. It has also increased political centralization.</p>
    <p>Free competition replaced the old system, and the bourgeoisie rose to power. Marx then says that a similar movement is underway at the present moment. Modern bourgeois society is in the process of turning on itself. Current productive forces are revolting against the current conditions of production. Commercial crises, due, ironically, to over-production, are threatening the existence of bourgeois society.   </p>
