    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Karl Marx (1818-1883) was a german philosopher, economist, and sociologist who met Friederich Engels (1820-1895), another socially-minded German philosopher. They joined a new political society called the League of the Just in 1847, creating the Communist Manifesto together. The Manifesto is split into three sections:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>historical context/nature of contemporary capitalist society</p>        
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>setting forth objectives</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>why it was better than other socialist movements</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Bourgeoise and Proletarians</h2>
    <p><b>bourgeoise = class of modern capitalist, owners of means of production and employers of wage labor</b></p>
    <p>In earlier ages, we saw society arranged into complicated class structures. For example, there were feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, and apprentices in medieval times. Modern bourgeois society sprouted from the ruins of feudal society. This society has become simplified into two rival camps--Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.</p>
    <p>The Manifesto shows how the modern bourgeoisie is the product of several revolutions in production and exchange. The development of the bourgeoisie began in the earliest towns and gained momentum with the Age of Exploration. Feudal guilds couldn&#39;t provide for increasing markets, and the manufacturing middle class took its place. However, demand kept growing, and manufacturing couldn&#39;t keep up. This led to the Industrial Revolution. </p>
    <p>A series of political developments accompanied the development of the bourgeoisie as a class. With the growth of Modern Industry and the world market, the bourgeoisie has gained exclusive political sway. The State serves the bourgeoisie&#39;s interests solely. Thus, exploitation that used to be veiled by religious and political &quot;illusions&quot; is now direct, brutal, and blatant.</p>
    <p>Because the bourgeoisie needs a constantly expanding market, it settles and establishes connections all over the globe. Production and consumption have taken on a cosmopolitan character in every country. This is true both for materials and intellectual output, as national sovereignty and isolationism become less and less possible to sustain. The bourgeoisie draws even the most barbarous nations into civilization and compels all countries to adopt its mode of production. It &quot;creates a world after its image.&quot; All become dependent on the bourgeoisie. It has also increased political centralization.</p>
    <p>Free competition replaced the old system, and the bourgeoisie rose to power. Marx then says that a similar movement is underway at the present moment. Modern bourgeois society is in the process of turning on itself. Current productive forces are revolting against the current conditions of production. Commercial crises, due, ironically, to over-production, are threatening the existence of bourgeois society.   </p>

    <p><b>proletariat = no means of production on their own, reduced to selling labor/power to live</b></p>
    <p>As the bourgeoisie developed, so did the proletariat, and the proletariat will eventually destroy the bourgeoisie. The proletarians live only as long as they can find work, and they can find work only as long as their labor increases capital. They are a commodity and are vulnerable to all the fluctuations of the market. Due to the development of machines, the proletariat&#39;s work has lost all &quot;charm.&quot; Furthermore, as his work becomes more repulsive, his wage only decreases. Distinctions of age and sex are becoming less important as all people are simply instruments of labor. Furthermore, the worker gets his wages from his exploitative boss; then, he is exploited by other bourgeoisie, such as his landlord.</p>
    <p>The proletariat is helped in its unification by the increased means of communication made possible by modern industry, allowing for the struggles to take on national character. While the organization of the proletariat into a class is continually destroyed by competition among workers, it rises again stronger each time. </p>
    <p>Marx explains that the only class today that is revolutionary is the proletariat. When a class gets the upper hand, it tries to subject all of society to its mode of appropriation. However, the proletariat lack any property of their own to retain or expand. Instead, they must destroy all ways of securing the private property at all. Another unique characteristic of the proletariat is that, while minorities started past movements, the proletariats are a vast majority and are acting in the interest of that majority. Marx writes that he has traced the proletariat&#39;s development through a veiled civil war, up to the point of open revolution and the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie. Until now, every society has been based on class oppression. </p>
    <p>However, for a class to be oppressed, its slavish existence must be sustainable: in contrast, laborers in modern industrial society are continually suffering a deterioration of their status; they become poorer and poorer. The bourgeoisie is thus unfit to rule because they cannot guarantee &quot;an existence to its slave within its slavery.&quot; Thus, with the development of Modern Industry, the bourgeoisie produces &quot;its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.&quot;</p>

    <h2>Proletarians and Communists</h2>
    <p>This goal of Communism challenges bourgeois freedom, and this is why the bourgeois condemns the Communist philosophy. Marx writes, &quot;You are horrified at our intending to do away with private property. But in your existing society, private property is already done away with for nine-tenths of the population.&quot; </p>
    <p>The Manifesto then addresses some objections to Communism. Many dissenters maintain that no one will work if private property is abolished. However, by this logic, bourgeois society should have been overcome with laziness long ago. In reality, it is presently the case that those who work don&#39;t acquire anything, and those who acquire things don&#39;t work. 
    Other opponents hold that Communism will destroy all intellectual products. However, this reflects a bourgeois misunderstanding. The disappearance of &quot;class culture&quot; is not the same thing as the disappearance of all cultures.</p>
    <p>The Communists &quot;plead guilty&quot; to wanting to do away with present familial relations in that they want to stop the exploitation of children by their parents. Similarly, they do not want to abolish children&#39;s education altogether but free it from the ruling class&#39;s control. </p>
    <p>We see then that the first step in the working-class revolution is to make the proletariat the ruling class. When class distinctions have disappeared, the public power will lose its political character. This is because political power is nothing more than &quot;the organized power of one class for oppressing another.&quot; Bourgeois society will be replaced by a society in which &quot;the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.&quot;e equally inevitable.&quot;</p>

    <h2>Socialist and Communist Literature</h2>
    <p>In this section, Marx presents and critiques three subsets of Socialist and Communist literature. </p>
    <p>The first subset is Reactionary Socialism. These groups fight against the rise of the bourgeoisie and modern Industry without realizing the historical process the bourgeoisie represents.</p>
    <p>The second subset of Socialism is Conservative, or Bourgeois, Socialism. This subset reflects the desires of a segment of the bourgeois to redress social grievances to guarantee the continued existence of bourgeois society. </p>
    <p>The third subset is Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism. This subset originated with the first attempts of the proletariat to achieve their ends. These socialists looked for new social laws to create the material conditions necessary to free the proletariat. </p>
