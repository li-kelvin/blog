    <p>Short: Reorganize your values and choose wisely about what you give a fuck about in life. </p>

    <h2>Chapter 1: Don’t Try</h2>
    <p>Stop trying. You become poor when you try to be rich. &nbsp;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>&ldquo;Ironically, this fixation on the positive only serves to remind us over and over again of what we are not, of what we lack, of what we should have been but failed to be.&rdquo;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Either you are, or you are not. So don&rsquo;t try to be somebody you&rsquo;re not.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>&ldquo;The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more; it&rsquo;s giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important.&rdquo;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>And that&rsquo;s basically what the book is about: Choose what to give a fuck about. Dedicate your fucks only to what&rsquo;s truly fuck-worthy. Choose what&rsquo;s important to you and give a fuck about that.&nbsp;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>&ldquo;Subtlety #1: Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.&rdquo;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>&ldquo;Subtlety #2: To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity.&rdquo;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>&ldquo;Subtlety #3: Whether you realize it or not, you are always choosing what to give a fuck about.&rdquo;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Short: Stop caring, stop trying, and just live and be.&nbsp;</p>
    <p></p>
    
    <h2>Chapter 2: Happiness Is a Problem</h2>
    <p>The belief that happiness is algorithmic &quot;if I achieve X, then I can be happy&quot; is the problem. Happiness is not a solvable equation.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>&ldquo;The secret sauce is in the solving of problems, not in not having problems in the first place.&rdquo;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Mark Manson tells this story of himself wanting to be a rock star. He dreamed about it and imagined himself being on stage with thousands of people yelling his name and stuff. But he never even came close. Why? Because he didn&rsquo;t want it. &ldquo;I wanted the reward and not the struggle. I wanted the result and not the process. I was in love with not the fight but only the victory.&rdquo;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Short: Only when you enjoy the journey will you reach your destination.</p>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Chapter 3: You Are Not Special</h2>
    <p>Fuck positivity. Sometimes things are fucked up, and we need to live with it. Yeah, it’s probably better to see the glass half-full than half-empty. But sometimes, the glass is full of shit. You cannot change that by being positive about it.</p>
    <p>We’ve become a generation that feels entitled. Entitled people feel that they deserve good things without actually earning them. Entitlement isn’t impervious. People who are entitled delude themselves into whatever feeds their sense of superiority.”</p>
    <p>Entitled people only see their positives. They can’t acknowledge their problems and weaknesses. And sooner or later, reality will hit, and it will be painful because reality is not a unicorn dancing on clouds. Life sucks.</p>
    <p>The vast majority of life is unextraordinary, indeed quite average. There’s nothing wrong with trying to become exceptional at something. However, you need to realize first that you’re only mediocre. And you need to work extremely hard to get there. You’re not there yet. Not even near. </p>
    <p>Short: Your average, with no special gift/talent at all. So outwork everyone. </p>

    <h2>Chapter 4: The Value of Suffering</h2>  
    <p>Marathon runners run through a lot of shit. Every day they get up and run a lot. That’s the shit they choose. Teachers go through a lot of shit as well, and so does everyone else. So, if you have to go through a lot of shit, which shit do you prefer? </p>
    <p><strong>The Self-Awareness Onion.</strong></p>
    <p>“Self-awareness is like an onion. There are multiple layers to it, and the more you peel them back, the more likely you’re going to start crying at inappropriate times.”</p>
    <p>The author offers a simple system to find out why something bothers you.
    Ask why.
    Keep on asking why (Why does this seem true?).</p>
