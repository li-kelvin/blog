    <p>Short: Reorganize your values and choose wisely about what you give a fuck about in life. </p>

    <h2>Chapter 1: Don’t Try</h2>
    <p>Stop trying. You become poor when you try to be rich. &nbsp;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>&ldquo;Ironically, this fixation on the positive only serves to remind us over and over again of what we are not, of what we lack, of what we should have been but failed to be.&rdquo;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Either you are, or you are not. So don&rsquo;t try to be somebody you&rsquo;re not.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>&ldquo;The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more; it&rsquo;s giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important.&rdquo;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>And that&rsquo;s basically what the book is about: Choose what to give a fuck about. Dedicate your fucks only to what&rsquo;s truly fuck-worthy. Choose what&rsquo;s important to you and give a fuck about that.&nbsp;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>&ldquo;Subtlety #1: Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.&rdquo;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>&ldquo;Subtlety #2: To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity.&rdquo;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>&ldquo;Subtlety #3: Whether you realize it or not, you are always choosing what to give a fuck about.&rdquo;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Short: Stop caring, stop trying, and just live and be.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>   
    
    <h2>Chapter 2: Happiness Is a Problem</h2>
    <p>The belief that happiness is algorithmic &quot;if I achieve X, then I can be happy&quot; is the problem. Happiness is not a solvable equation.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>&ldquo;The secret sauce is in the solving of problems, not in not having problems in the first place.&rdquo;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Mark Manson tells this story of himself wanting to be a rock star. He dreamed about it and imagined himself being on stage with thousands of people yelling his name and stuff. But he never even came close. Why? Because he didn&rsquo;t want it. &ldquo;I wanted the reward and not the struggle. I wanted the result and not the process. I was in love with not the fight but only the victory.&rdquo;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Short: Only when you enjoy the journey will you reach your destination.</p>
