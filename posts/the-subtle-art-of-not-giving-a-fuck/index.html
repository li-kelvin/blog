    <p>​<strong>In short:</strong> Prioritize your fucks wisely.</p>

    <h3 id="chapter-1-don-t-try">Chapter 1: Don’t Try</h3>
    <p>Stop trying. You become poor when you try to be rich. It is the fixation on the positive that reminds us of what we lack and failed to be. Either you are, or you are not. So don’t try to be somebody you’re not.</p>
    <p>“The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more; it’s giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important.”</p>
    <p>“Subtlety #1: Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.”</p>
    <p>“Subtlety #2: To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity.”</p>
    <p>“Subtlety #3: Whether you realize it or not, you are always choosing what to give a fuck about.”</p>
    
    <h3 id="chapter-2-happiness-is-a-problem">Chapter 2: Happiness Is a Problem</h3>
    <p>Happiness is not algorithmic. &quot;if I achieve X, then I can be happy&quot; is the problem. Therefore, happiness is not a solvable equation.</p>
    <p>“The secret sauce is in the solving of problems, not in not having problems in the first place.”</p>
    <p>Mark Manson wanted to be a rock star. He dreamed about it and imagined himself being on stage with thousands of people yelling his name and stuff. But he never even came close. Why? Because he didn’t want it. </p>
    <p>“I wanted the reward and not the struggle. I wanted the result and not the process. I was in love with not the fight but only the victory.”</p>
    
    <h3 id="chapter-3-you-are-not-special">Chapter 3: You Are Not Special</h3>
    <p>Fuck positivity. Sometimes things are fucked up, and we need to live with it. Yeah, it’s probably better to see the glass half-full than half-empty. But sometimes, the glass is full of shit. You cannot change that by being positive about it.</p>
    <p>Entitled people only see their positives. They can’t acknowledge their problems and weaknesses. And sooner or later, reality will hit, and it will be painful because life sucks. The vast majority of life is unextraordinary, indeed quite average. </p>
    <p>There’s nothing wrong with trying to become exceptional at something. However, you need to realize first that you’re only mediocre. And you need to work extremely hard to get there. You’re not there yet. Not even near.</p>
    
    <h3 id="chapter-4-the-value-of-suffering">Chapter 4: The Value of Suffering</h3>
    <p>Marathon runners go through a lot of shit. Every day they get up and run a lot. Teachers go through a lot of shit as well, and so does everyone else. So, if you have to go through a lot of shit, which shit do you prefer?</p>
    <p><strong>The Self-Awareness Onion</strong><br>
    To find out why something bothers you. Ask why. Then keep asking.
    “Self-awareness is like an onion. There are multiple layers to it, and the more you peel them back, the more likely you’re going to start crying at inappropriate times.”</p>
    <p><strong>Shitty Values</strong><br>
    Pleasure is not the cause of happiness; instead, it is the effect—the easiest to obtain and the easiest to lose.</p>
    <p>Material success. “When people measure themselves not by their behavior, but by the status symbols they’re able to collect, then not only are they shallow, but they’re probably assholes as well.”</p>
    <p>Always Being Right. “People who base their self-worth on being right about everything prevent themselves from learning from their mistakes.”</p>
    <p>Staying Positive &quot;These things make us feel like shit. And that’s fine. Negative emotions are a necessary component of emotional health.”</p>
    <p><strong>What Are Good Values?</strong><br></p>
        <ol>
          <li>reality-based</li>
          <li>socially constructive</li>
          <li>immediate and controllable</li>
        </ol>
    <p>“Some examples of good, healthy values: honesty, innovation, vulnerability, standing up for oneself, standing up for others, self-respect, curiosity, charity, humility, creativity.”</p>
    <p>Self-improvement is about choosing better things to give a fuck about. Because when you give better fucks, you get better problems. And when you get better problems, you get a better life.</p>
    
    <h3 id="chapter-5-you-are-always-choosing-">Chapter 5:You Are Always Choosing.</h3>
    <p>If we realize that we’re responsible for everything in our lives, then we get to improve ourselves. No matter the hand you’re dealt, it’s your responsibility to deal with the hand.</p>
    <p>Many people may blame your unhappiness, but nobody is ever responsible for your sorrow but you. This is because you always get to choose how you see things, react to things, and value things.</p>
    <p>“Often, the only difference between a problem being painful or being powerful is a sense that we chose it and that we are responsible for it.”</p>
    
    <h3 id="chapter-6-you-re-wrong-about-everything">Chapter 6: You’re Wrong About Everything</h3>
    <p>A while back, people were certain that things that we know today are complete BS. For example, people believed that the world was flat. The same holds for the younger version of you.</p>
    <p>“Certainty is the enemy of growth.”</p>
    <p>In most situations, we get an intuition that says something is good or bad. But in reality, we don’t know. It seems a certain way, but we don’t know. So maybe it’s good, and perhaps it’s terrible. How about taking it as it comes? It’s okay how it is. Maybe it’ll benefit us, and perhaps it’ll harm us. We simply do not know for sure.</p>
    <p>Question #1: What if I’m wrong?
    “We’re the world’s worst observers of ourselves. So when we’re angry or jealous, we’re oftentimes the last ones to figure it out.”</p>
    <p>Question #2: What would it mean if I were wrong?
    “If I’m wrong, then I’m behaving like a total asshole.”</p>
    <p>Question #3: Would being wrong create better/worse problems than my current problem?
    “That’s simply reality: if it feels like it’s you versus the world, chances are it’s really just you versus yourself.”</p>
    
    <h3 id="chapter-7-failure-is-the-way-forward">Chapter 7: Failure Is the Way Forward</h3>
    <p>Talent is overrated. It&#39;s more about the work you put into something rather than your preconditions. If you want to succeed at something, you will undoubtedly have to fail many times. So failure and pain are part of the process.</p>
    <p><strong>The &quot;Do Something&quot; Principle</strong> <br>
    &quot;&#39;If you&#39;re stuck on a problem, don&#39;t just sit there and think about it; start working on it. The simple act of working on it will cause the right ideas to show up.&#39;&quot;</p>
    <p>Don&#39;t just sit there. Do something. The answers will follow. Action isn&#39;t just the effect of motivation; it&#39;s also the cause of it.</p>
    
    <h3 id="chapter-8-the-importance-of-saying-no">Chapter 8: The Importance of Saying No</h3>
    <p>People say yes to things they don&#39;t want to please others. So stop.
    &quot;To value X, we must reject non-X.&quot;</p>
    
    <h3 id="chapter-9-and-then-you-die">Chapter 9: And Then You Die</h3>
    <p>Death Terror: At some point, humans become aware of the inevitability of death. This leads to deep existential anxiety that underlies everything we think or do.
    Immortality Projects: Humans have two selves: a physical self that eats, sleeps, and a conceptual self which is how we see ourselves. We try to ensure that our conceptual self will not be forgotten.</p>
    <p>&quot;The only way to be comfortable with death is to understand and see yourself as something bigger than yourself; to choose values that stretch beyond serving yourself. This is the basic root of all happiness.&quot;</p>
