    <h2 id="chapter-one-">Chapter One:</h2>
    <p>Mr. Jones lives on the Manor Farm; he is an alcoholic. The farm animals go to the barn to hear what old Major, the well-respected prize Middle White boar, says about a recent dream. Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher are the three farm dogs. Boxer and Clover are the two cart-horses. Muriel is the white goat, and Benjamin is the donkey. First, major tells the animals that humans are enemies because humans force animals to do all the jobs they cannot do. He also says they must work to overthrow the human race. Next, major teaches them a song, but they wake up Mr. Jones while singing it, so they must go to sleep.</p>
    
    <h2 id="chapter-two-">Chapter Two:</h2>
    <p>Three nights after the meeting, Major dies in his sleep. The animals started to think about preparing for the future rebellion. They came up with a system of rebelling ideas which they called animalism. One night, Mr. Jones became so drunk at a bar he didn’t return to his farm till the next day. The animals were unfed and became so hungry they broke into the store-shed and started to eat the food in the bins. When Mr. Jones returns and sees what the animals have done, he and four other men begin beating the animals. The animals then began pounding on the humans, who eventually ran away for their life. The animals were thrilled not to be anybody’s slave anymore; they created “The Seven Commandments.”</p>
    
    <h2 id="chapter-three-">Chapter Three:</h2>
    <p>The animals all worked hard in the field collectively and were rewarded with a great harvest season. Boxer was the hardest worker of all the animals. His motto was, “I will work harder.” Some animals had trouble learning and memorizing “The Seven Commandments,” so Snowball decided to simplify the Commandments to “Four legs good, two legs bad.”</p>
    
    <h2 id="chapter-four-">Chapter Four:</h2>
    <p>Snowball and Napoleon send pigeons to neighboring farms, telling them of their rebellion and urging them to do the same. Mr. Jones sits at the Red Lion Pub and drinks his problems away. In October, Mr. Jones and other farmers come back to Manor Farm to recapture it. The animals knew that Mr. Jones would come back and were prepared for it. Snowball was in charge of defensive operations. Although the animals once again defeated Mr. Jones and his friends, Boxer accidentally kills a boy.</p>
    
    <h2 id="chapter-five-">Chapter Five:</h2>
    <p>Clover confronts Mollie about her lacking work ethic; soon after, Mollie disappears. Snowball and Napoleon had become bitter rivals with one another. Snowball wanted to build a windmill on the farm, but Napoleon wanted no part of it. Nine dogs chase Snowball off the farm. Although Napoleon announces that the windmill will be built, he claims that he wasn’t in favor of it because it was his idea stolen by Snowball.</p>
    
    <h2 id="chapter-six-">Chapter Six:</h2>
    <p>The animals work very hard for the entirety of the year. The animals had enough food to last them throughout the summer but would have to work hard to surplus in the winter. Every Monday, Mr. Whymper comes around to the farm and gets orders for food or supplies. Mr. Jones was as far away from the farm as he could, to the other side of the country. One morning in November, they awoke to find the almost finished windmill in ruins. Even though there had been a violent windstorm the night before, Napoleon blames it on Snowball. Napoleon also says that they will begin the rebuilding immediately and build every day until it is finished.</p>
    
    <h2 id="chapter-seven-">Chapter Seven:</h2>
    <p>In January, food was very low on the farm. Napoleon made a deal with Mr. Whymper to give him four-hundred eggs in return for grain and food until summer came. The animals believe that Snowball snuck into the farm at night and caused mischief on the farm. One night at a meeting, the dogs attack the four pigs and rip their throats out. They killed everybody affiliated with Snowball’s rebellion from Napolean, including the hens, three sheep, and others.</p>
    
    <h2 id="chapter-eight-">Chapter Eight:</h2>
    <p>The animals worked so hard; they sometimes thought it would be better if Mr. Jones were still on the farm. Napoleon never came out of the house, or when he did, it was a very rare occasion. If anything good happened to any of the animals, they would thank Napoleon for their good fortune. During the summer, three hens confessed to plotting to kill Napoleon, as ordered by Snowball. They were immediately killed. They finish the windmill in autumn. Fredrick and two dozen more men attack Animal Farm and destroy the windmill. This enrages the animals, and they push the men off the farm. The animals get drunk from whisky.</p>
    
    <h2 id="chapter-nine-">Chapter Nine:</h2>
    <p>They reduce the animal’s amount of food again during the winter, except for the dogs and pigs. In April, the animals decided that they would declare Animal Farm a Republic. Napoleon is unanimously voted President. Boxer falls down and says that his lung is bothering him. A van came, and they thought it would take Boxer to the hospital, but the side of the van read, “Alfred Simmonds, Horse Slaughterer, and Glue Boiler, Willingdon.” Squealer said that Boxer died at the Wellington Hospital. The hospital bought the van from the slaughterer and hadn’t remarked the side. The animals are very sad about this and buy more whisky.</p>
    
    <h2 id="chapter-ten-">Chapter Ten:</h2>
    <p>Many years went by on the farm; the only animals from the Rebellion still alive were Clover, Benjamin, Moses, and many pigs. The farm was doing tremendous financially and with food. Pilkington and Napoleon become friends. Napoleon announces that Animal Farm will be called the Manor Farm again.</p>
