    <h2 id=ethereum-architecture>Ethereum Architecture</h2>
    <p>To understand the high-level architecture of Ethereum, we compare it with the traditional client/server architecture. I really like <a href=https://www.zastrin.com/courses/ethereum-primer/lessons/2-1>Zastrin</a>&rsquo;s illustration.</p>
    <p>Here is how a traditional client/server architecture looks like:</p>
    <p><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BDHU/Page_pics/master/posts/ethereum/Webapp-Architecture.png#center alt=client-server-architecture></p>
    <p>The main point is that the web application is deployed on centralized platforms or hosting services like AWS. All client applications need to access the centralized component for requested services.</p>
    <p>The architecture of Ethereum is shown below:</p>
    <p><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BDHU/Page_pics/master/posts/ethereum/Ethereum-Architecture.png#center alt=ethereum-architecture></p>
    <p>The major difference here is that each client interacts with a decentralized application instead. Each computer holds a replica of all the data as well as the code. You can think of your computer as a dedicated mini server handling only your requests. Of course, what this implies is you will need to download the entire Ethereum blockchain to be able to use the application.</p>
    <p>This is obviously infeasible. In practice, there are solutions like <a href=https://metamask.io/>Metamask</a> to mitigate the problem so your storage space won&rsquo;t be saturated. But the high-level concept holds.</p>
    <p>A Ethereum blockchain consists of two components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Database: this is similar to the database we use in the traditional client/server architecture. The difference lies in how the data is represented and stored. Ethereum stores events as transactions which are exactly the same as BTC transactions, but are much more general as they can store anything ranging from a git commit message to a blog post. It can even be used to represent something more abstract such as ownership of artwork in the form of non-fungible tokens. Because Ethereum is a public blockchain, all the data stored in the blockchain will be visible to the public.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Smart Contract: this is fancy name for application code. The code is compiled into Ethereum Byte Code and then executed by the EVM.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
