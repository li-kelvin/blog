    <p>I always pictured my 20&#39;s to be different. More adventures. More challenges. More memories. Instead, I&#39;ve been staring at the same screen for 10+ hours a day for the past year. The life I am living is boring and when you are bored, do something new! This is the beginning of my 10-minute journals, where I write about anything on my mind.</p>
    <p>Entry #1:</p>
    <p>Life has been beating my ass recently. It makes it harder to watch the people you love succeed. 
    Damm, I sound like an asshole. I&#39;m just scared of falling behind. Thanks to Mark Manson, I know that problems suck, they need to be solved, and I&#39;m going to be the solution.</p>
    <p>This is the tale of Kelvin Li, finally deciding to carry the boat. May this hopefully one day serve as a reminder that anything is possible as long as you do the work.</p>
