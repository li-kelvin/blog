    <p><strong>In short:</strong> There is no suffering in presentness. There may be pain but never suffering. </p>
    <p>The novel takes place in ancient India, 600 years before the birth of Christ. </p>
    
    <h3 id="the-brahmins-son">The Brahmins Son</h3>
    <p>Siddhartha is a learned and handsome young Brahmin who could be a  prince. Instead, Siddhartha studies Hindu wisdom by elders alongside his best friend, Govinda. He finds himself dissatisfied. He believes that Brahmins, such as his father, have successfully learned all the contents of holy books, but he does not think they have reached enlightenment. </p>
    <p>Siddhartha tells Govinda that he plans to join a group of Samanas. Samanas are wandering mendicant priests - half-naked and starved. They beg others for food. They believe that the only way to reach enlightenment is through asceticism. Asceticism is the rejection of the body, including physical desire. As Siddhartha departs to join the Samanas, he is pleased to find that Govinda will join him.</p>
    
    <h3 id="with-the-samanas">With the Samanas</h3>
    <p>The Samana believe that true enlightenment arrives when the Self is entirely negated/destroyed. Siddhartha quickly learns the way to be free of life’s traditional trappings. As a result, he loses all desire for any sustenance that exceeds that required to live. However, he finds that destruction will not bring him what he seeks and that this group has enjoyed no more success than the Brahmins. Siddhartha and Govinda remain with the Samanas for three years. </p>
    <p>They then hear a rumor of the existence of an enlightened one called Gotama the Buddha. Siddhartha and Govinda decide to seek out and follow Gotama. Siddhartha’s announcement of their decision to leave anger the Samana elder. </p>
    
    <h3 id="gotama">Gotama</h3>
    <p>Siddhartha and Govinda are deeply impressed by Gotama. Pure enlightenment seems to radiate from his being. Govinda promptly decides to take the lifestyle prescribed and stay with Gotama forever. However, Siddhartha has doubts and discovers that he has difficulty completely accepting Gotama’s teachings. </p>
    <p>Siddhartha makes a note of a contradiction: How is it possible to embrace the unity of all things, as Gotama requires if one is also instructed to overcome the physical world. Gotama explains that he does not aim to provide perfect mathematical comprehension of the universe but rather to help people find freedom from suffering. Siddhartha replies that while it’s true that Gotama himself has found Nirvana, he did it by himself, with no assistance from a teacher. </p>
    <p>Govinda wants to stay with Gotama, so Siddhartha leaves by himself. He embarks on a search to find a way to achieve knowledge of the meaning of life without being dependent on religious instruction.</p>
    
    <h3 id="awakening">Awakening</h3>
    <p>Siddhartha is done with teachers and is determined to know, learn from, and understand himself. Siddhartha experiences a sudden infusion of forceful certainty in his capacity for self-realization. He now feels that he is now a man. </p>
    <p>He knows that his path to Nirvana cannot come from following the prescribed lifestyle of another. Instead, he feels certain that his way to enlightenment must come from within himself. He has an impulse to go home but recognizes that his home is now part of his past. He knows that he is entirely alone. He momentarily shudders at this thought.</p>
    
    <h3 id="kamala">Kamala</h3>
    <p>Siddhartha wanders for a period and spends the first night in a ferryman’s hut. The ferrymen inform Siddhartha that he has learned a great deal from the river. Siddhartha is comforted by what the ferryman says. Siddhartha feels guilty about not paying the ferryman when they get to the other bank the next day. However, the ferryman does not mind not being compensated for his services. He says that Siddhartha will present him with a gift at that time.</p>
    <p>A young woman appears at the village’s edge. She tries to seduce Siddhartha. While she temps him, an inner voice instructs him to resist. Yet, the next woman he sees as he goes into the city tempts him in a way he finds he cannot resist. This is Kamala. She is an elegant and beautiful courtesan. </p>
    <p>Siddhartha goes to the river for a bath. Then, he gets a haircut and a shave. After this, he goes back to Kamala, who finds it amusing that a Samana would emerge from the forest and ask to be instructed in the art of love. So, she trades a kiss in exchange for a poem declaring he will teach him no more until he comes back as Kamaswami, a wealthy businessman equal.</p>
    
    <h3 id="amongst-the-people">Amongst the People</h3>
    <p>Kamaswami is impressed by his abilities and says he will allow Siddhartha to be his protégé, taking the role of a merchant. Siddhartha finds it relatively easy to handle the business world. </p>
    <p>The time he spent as a Samana taught him an important lesson: that many people live in childish and animalistic ways, allowing themselves to suffer over things with very minimal meaning, such as pleasure, honor, and money. He rejects this kind of suffering. </p>
    <p>Siddhartha and Kamala feel a sense of connection and great intimacy. However, Siddhartha is interested in his time with Kamala only because it gives him knowledge of the world of love to achieve enlightenment ultimately. Kamala and Siddhartha both recognize that they are the type of people who cannot be genuinely in love.</p>
    
    <h3 id="samsara">Samsara</h3>
    <p>Siddhartha becomes wealthy. He enjoys the intimate company of Kamala. He now feels a sense of superiority over those who seek worldly riches and pleasures. He gradually falls under the same spell. He eats rich food, wears the finest garments, and has always had the spiritual voice within him is dead. He is unable to find peace even in his relationship with Kamala.</p>
    <p>Twenty years have passed. Siddhartha starts to have dreams that indicate it is likely now time for him to move on. He finds that the inner voice has been quiet for too long.</p>
    <p>He recognizes that he has been playing the game of Samsara. Samsara is the cyclical path of life in which the individual lives, suffers, and dies. While he needed to play the game, he did not have to play it forever. He departs from the city, not telling anyone he is leaving. Kamala does not take any more lovers from the day forward. She soon finds that she is pregnant with Siddhartha’s child.</p>
    
    <h3 id="by-the-river">By the River</h3>
    <p>When Siddhartha leaves the city, he goes back into the countryside. He feels so miserable that he thinks about suicide. He contemplates how neither indulgence/desire allowed him to achieve enlightenment.</p>
    <p>He is getting ready to slip into the water and let himself drown, but the sacred word Om suddenly reverberates inside him. This awakens his spirit. He sees how foolish his plan of suicide is, and he lies down in the grass to sleep.</p>
    <p>When Siddhartha wakes up, he finds that a Buddhist monk is meditating beside him. He sees that it is Govinda. Govinda still believes that his path as a spiritual pilgrim is right. Siddhartha says that he is a spiritual pilgrim, too. Govinda is still skeptical, but he gives his old friend a respectful bow before going on his way.</p>
    <p>Siddhartha concludes that his overthinking has compromised his prior attempts at achieving enlightenment. In a way, he tried too hard to find what he is pursuing.</p>
    
    <h3 id="the-ferryman">The Ferryman</h3>
    <p>Siddhartha decides to live a new life at the river and meets the same ferryman who once helped him traverse the river years earlier named Vasudeva. Vasudeva teaches Siddhartha everything he needs to know to be a ferryman. During this time, Siddhartha gently questions Vasudeva about the link between his life at the river and his enlightened detachment. Vasudeva explains that the river holds many secrets and lessons. </p>
    <p>The first lesson the river teaches Siddhartha is that time does not exist.
    All difficulties, hostilities, anxieties, suffering, and self-torment have their anchor in time. When people can overcome the idea of time, all of this will disappear. </p>
    <p>A poisonous snake bites kamala, and Vasudeva hears the boy’s cry for assistance. Siddhartha recognizes Kamala, and he finds her son somewhat familiar. Kamala stays alive long enough to speak to him. She sees that Siddhartha is the same as Buddha. Siddhartha feels that he is blessed himself. He has a son now. </p>
    
    <h3 id="the-son">The Son</h3>
    <p>The boy, however, is cynical and spoiled. He dislikes being with the two ferrymen and wants to go back to the city and the life of wealth he has always had. Siddhartha discovers that he loves his child, although he has never been able to love before this. Vasudeva eventually tells Siddhartha that he should allow the boy to leave if he wishes, reminding him that his father had not persuaded him to stay home. </p>
    <p>The boy runs away, taking all of the money. Vasudeva thinks that Siddhartha ought to let the boy go, but Siddhartha believes that he needs to follow his son. He sees the city again, and many memories come into his mind. He recalls the time he spent with Kamala and Kamaswami. He suddenly realizes that he needs to let his son go. He knows that no amount of reasoning could persuade him to want to stay. </p>
    
    <h3 id="om">Om</h3>
    <p>Siddhartha meditates on the loss of his son for many days. Just like a river. He recognizes that there is an inevitable flow to life. He comprehends that there are some sorrows in life that we cannot prevent and that will pass through generations. He now has a feeling of peace. </p>
    <p>He suddenly recognizes that his Self is only a part of the great perfection.  Vasudeva witnesses this and declares that he has been waiting for this to happen. He leaves, going into the forest. Siddhartha is left to be the ferryman.</p>
    
    <h3 id="govinda">Govinda</h3>
    <p>Govinda comes back to the river to search for enlightenment failing to recognize Siddhartha. Siddhartha tells Govinda that he is searching too diligently and that his goal has possessed him. He tells Govinda that it is impossible to teach his wisdom. Wisdom cannot be taught because of the limitations of verbal explanations. While knowledge can be passed along, individuals must find their own wisdom. </p>
    <p>Every truth has an opposite truth. No one person is ever completely saintly or completely sinful. Siddhartha and Govinda have both found the enlightenment they started to seek in the days of their youth.</p>
